Comments: I see that you have a background image to fit the feel of a trivia game.  Good idea.  The Container for the questions and clickable buttons have a transparent background.  This can add a way to still see the background and not loose some of the feel.  Its possible to make it a little more transparent maybe and/or use a different color to fit the theme of your background more.  I see use of bootstrap which can make styling easier or difficult depending on your color preferences for the theme.  The questions display properly and your functions from JS work just fine.  I think in the future you can add the answers, clap tracks or triva music to the background, and display answers.
